# Phoebe take-home interview

## Overview

Phoebe builds AI teammates for home health. A feature that we offer is the ability for home health agencies to report an open shift, and automatically trigger outreach (via SMS, phone call, and email) to qualifying caregivers in order to fill the shift as quickly as possible. You can see a demo of this functionality on our website: https://www.phoebe.work/call-out.

For this project, you will build a simplified version of the shift fanout service.

## Goal

Build a Python micro-service that fills open caregiver shifts by fanning out SMS and voice notifications, accepting the first claim, and escalating if unfilled.

## Guidelines

- Plan to spend _roughly_ 6 hours on this assignment.
- The included boilerplate code is only a suggested starting point — you may modify it as desired.
- Do not add any additional third-party dependencies or external services.
- You are welcome to use AI tools while working on this project, but please write the project reflection yourself.
- Git commit your progress as you work to document your incremental process (don't squash your work into one commit)

## Functional requirements

- The service interface should expose two endpoints:
    - An API route to trigger fanout for a shift: `POST /shifts/{shift_id}/fanout`
    - An API route to receive an incoming SMS/phone message: `POST /messages/inbound`
- The escalation logic should consist of two rounds of contact attempts:
    1. An immediate round of contact attempts via SMS.
    2. If no caregiver accepts the shift within 10 minutes, a second round of contact attempts via phone call.
- Only caregivers with the role required by the shift (LPN, RN, CNA, etc.) should be contacted for a shift.
- The first caregiver to accept should be assigned to the shift.
- A shift should only ever be given to one caregiver, even if multiple caregivers accept it near-simultaneously.

## Constraints

- Endpoints should be idempotent; re-posting the same shift fan-out must not send duplicate notifications.
- The service may have multiple in-process worker tasks running concurrently. Guard against race conditions when marking a shift as claimed.
- For storage, use the provided in-memory key/value database (modify as desired); do not use a persistent database or migrations.

## Assumptions & simplifications

- We do not need to handle the case where no caregiver ever accepts the shift.
- Assume that sending and receiving phone calls has the same API as a text message: we send an outgoing message and receive an incoming message. Don't worry about multi-turn phone conversations or streaming call transcripts.
- Assume only one instance of this micro-service is running (no cross-process locking required).

## What’s included

- FastAPI bootstrap (`app/api.py`)
- Stub notifier (`app/notifier.py`)
- Stub intent classifier (`app/intent.py`)
- Generic in-memory key/value database (`app/database.py`)
- Example tests (`tests/example_test.py`)
- Sample JSON data to use as reference (`sample_data.json`).

Everything else (how you model data, structure modules, design the service) is up to you to decide.

## Project reflection

Upon completion, write a brief reflection on the project in [PROJECT_REFLECTION.md](PROJECT_REFLECTION.md). Include:

- Explanation of any design decisions or tradeoffs made.
- Explanation of how you used LLM tools in your process (if applicable).

This written reflection is the only part of the assignment that we request you do NOT use AI tools to assist with. We want to hear your voice and writing style! It does not need to be long or extremely polished, but it should be your candid take on what you have created and your process of doing so.

## Submission

Make a ZIP file of the repo with your completed work and send it to us via email.

## Environment setup

Install [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) (for Windows see [installation guide](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/)):

```bash
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
```

If using VSCode/Cursor, we recommend you install the [Ruff](https://marketplace.cursorapi.com/items?itemName=charliermarsh.ruff) and [Pylance](https://marketplace.cursorapi.com/items?itemName=ms-python.vscode-pylance) extensions.

## Commands

#### Run tests

```bash
uv run pytest
```

#### Lint code

```bash
uv run ruff check
```

#### Run API server

_(Not strictly necessary, only if you want to test manually making requests to your api server via `curl`)_

```bash
uv run uvicorn app.api:create_app --factory --reload
```

```bash
curl http://127.0.0.1:8000/health
```
